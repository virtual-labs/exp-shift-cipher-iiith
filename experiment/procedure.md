**STEP 1 :** Start by examining the given cipher For k=3, we obtain a meaningful plain text namely "how are you" and hence we are done.

**Using the Simulation Tools:**

- You can use the "Test All Shifts" button in **PART II** to automatically perform this brute force analysis
- The frequency analysis tool can help identify patterns that suggest the correct shift value
- The manual encryption/decryption tool in **PART III** allows you to verify specific hypotheses
- The feedback system in **PART IV** provides immediate verification of your solutionext in **PART I** of the simulation page. You can click "Next Ciphertext" to get different challenge ciphertexts to decrypt.

**STEP 2 :** Use the analysis tools provided in **PART II** to help with your cryptanalysis:

- **Frequency Analysis (üìä)**: Analyze letter frequencies in the current ciphertext to identify patterns
- **Test All Shifts (üîç)**: Automatically try all possible shift values (0-25) to find meaningful text
- **Rough Work Area**: Use the text area to make notes, record your observations, and keep track of promising decryptions
- **Clear Button (üóëÔ∏è)**: Clear your rough work area when needed

**STEP 3 :** Use the encryption/decryption tool in **PART III** to manually test specific shift values:

- Enter text in the plaintext area
- Select a shift value (0-25) from the dropdown
- Click "Encrypt" to see the ciphertext result
- Click "Decrypt" to reverse the process
- This helps you understand how the shift cipher works and test your hypotheses

**STEP 4 :** Once you've identified the correct plaintext and shift key through analysis:

- Enter the decrypted plaintext in the **PART IV** solution text area
- Select the corresponding shift key from the dropdown
- Click "Check my answer!" to verify your solution
- The feedback area will show whether your answer is correct and provide hints if needed

**STEP 5 [OPTIONAL] :** Verify your understanding by using **PART III** to encrypt your solution plaintext with your discovered key to confirm it produces the original ciphertext.

**An Example:**

Let us say we have a cipher text "KRZ DUH BRX" generated by a shift cipher.
We carry out the brute force attack as follows:

For k=0:

    cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
    plain text: k r z d u h b r x

For k=1:

    cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
    plain text: j q y c t g a q w

For k=2:

    cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
    plain text: i p x b s f z p v

For k=3:

    cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
    plain text: h o w a r e y o u

For k=3, we obtain a meaningful plain text namely how are you and hence we are done.
