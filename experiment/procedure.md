**STEP 1 :** For the given ciphertext in the **PART I** of the simulation page, the first step is to decrypt it using each of the twenty-six different keys, k=0,1,...,25 and obtain the corresponding plaintexts. For decryption, you may use the tool given in the **PART III** of the simulation page.

**STEP 2 :** After each decryption, you may cut-and-paste the resultant plaintext in the scratch-pad in the **(PART II)** of the simulation page, if you need to remember it.

**STEP 3 :** Finally, observe the plaintexts and choose the most appropriate one (the one that is a meaningful English text) as the recovered plaintext and cut-and-paste it in the text-field named **PART IV** "Solution Plaintext". Also select the corresponding key in the text-field named "Key" and click on "Check My answer" Button.

**STEP 4 [OPTIONAL] :** Verify that your answer is correct, by encrypting the solution plaintext with your key.


**An Example:**

Let us say we have a cipher text "KRZ DUH BRX" generated by a shift cipher.
We carry out the brute force attack as follows:

For k=0:

	cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
	plain text: k r z d u h b r x


For k=1:

	cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
	plain text: j q y c t g a q w

For k=2:

	cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
	plain text: l p x b s f z p v


For k=3:

	cipher text: K R Z D U H B R X
	plain text: h o w a r e y o u


For k=3, we obtain a meaningful plain text namely how are you and hence we are done.
