Use the **PART III** provided in the simulation page to solve the following problems. The tool includes a shift cipher calculator and a workspace for your analysis.

**1. Encrypt the following plaintext using key k= 7.**

Given:

- **Plaintext:** `Lord Rama was a good king.`
- **Key:** k = 7

**2.Given a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, determine the key used for encryption.**

Given:

- **Plaintext:** `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- **Ciphertext:** `tuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrs`

Hint: Compare the first few letters: a→t, b→u, c→v...

**3. How many different keys are possible with an n-letter alphabet?**

**4. For English alphabet (n=26): How many distinct keys exist?**

**5. Decrypt the following ciphertext using brute force attack.**

Given: Ciphertext: `HAAHJR HA KHDU`
